So I hooked it up on a breadboard and because I don’t have a oscilloscope I used 
my soundcard and a software called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zeitnitz.eu/scope_en&quot;&gt;“Soundcard Scope”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had some problem with the power supply to the op-amp at the beginning because I
don’t have a proper PSU. So I first used a pack of two AA batteries and used the “middlepoint” as ground which gave me ±1,5V.
The circuit didn’t amplified the signal at all at this point so I got a bit worried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then I remembered that I have a “TI-82 stat” calculator which has a pack of 4 AAA batteries so I tried to use that instead.
And with the ±3V the signal got amplified to the point where I was happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the circuit board is now ordered and on the way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’ve decided to start blogging my projects that I’m doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly for myself so I can use this as a sort of portfolio and a way to go back
and check how I solved some things, if I would encounter the same problem in the future.
And if someone could use this to help their project that’s just a bonus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well enough about this and more about the actual project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-project&quot;&gt;The Project&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m going to make a drum triggered LED circuit that will be connected to the 
microphone on the drum and light a LED-strip when the drum is hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also plans to make the LEDs controllable by an DMX512 controller, so it can be controlled by a light mixer. 
Maybe it could act as a controller itself and remotely control other lights as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway the plan from the start is to use separate units for every drum trigger 
equipped with a Atmega328P as controller. Those units could then either operate 
individually or be connected to one master unit that could make decisions about 
color, DMX commands and stuff like that. The way (at the moment) they would 
communicate is via UART and with a multiplexer on the master unit it is able to 
talk to all the devices with just one UART port. It would maybe be better to have this 
communication through a bus instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The power to all trigger devices should be coming from the master unit together with the communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the schematics and code in it’s current state at my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Xartos/DrumSense&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">About this blog</summary></entry></feed>
